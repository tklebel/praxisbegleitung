# Praxisbegleitung

This repo hosts a presentation for a class to reflect on an internship. The presentation was held on 19th of January 2016.

The presentation is powered by [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), which is included as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

Content is written to `main.md`, which is then converted with the `makefile` to `index.html`. Styling is done via `style.css`.
